1)Find out the top 5 most visited destinations.

2)Which month has seen the most number of cancellations due to bad weather?

group_month = group Filter_data by month;
 
count_month = foreach D generate group, COUNT(C.cancelled);
 
desc_ord= order count_month   by $1 DESC;
 
Result = limit desc_ord 1;
